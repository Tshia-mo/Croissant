    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A <strong>Croissant</strong> (French pronunciation: [kʁwasɑ̃] ⓘ) is a
      buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian
      kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[1][better
      source needed] Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape.
      The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
      succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
      laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a
      puff pastry.
